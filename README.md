# Numerical Analysis final project

## About

This repo was made for the [Numerical Analysis](https://github.com/luca-heltai/numerical-analysis-2022-2023) exam at the University of Trieste that I took during my studies in [Data Science and Scientific Computing](https://dssc.units.it/).

The project assignment is a list of exercises that can be found in the [`original-assigment.ipynb`](./original-assigment.ipynb) file and in the course repository. The solutions are presented in the [`solution.ipynb`](./solution.ipynb) file.

###  Set up the enviroment

All the presented code was tested in a `python3.12.0` environment. The list of all the used packages, with their own version, is reported in the [requirements.txt](./requirements.txt) file. 

To get started you just need to set up a virtual environment and install the requirements with the following commands:

```bash
conda create -n <env_name> python=3.12.0
conda activate <env_name>
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
